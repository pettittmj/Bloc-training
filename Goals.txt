Mark,

My real goal here in bloc is to hopefully help jump start me into becoming a developer. 
Currently I dabble a little bit and can make minor changes and usually locate bugs 
and fix them, but if i was asked to develop a new web app or page, that would be beyond 
my realm. I come from a database background and before that I did sysadmin work. 
I will try to give a lot of effort into this program because it appears to have great 
worth to me.

I look forward to our meeting tomorrow, 
Matt
